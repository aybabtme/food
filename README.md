MIT licensed. Comes with absolutely no warranties. Don't blame me if you poison yourself. Most of the recipes are adapted from other places, which I'll link to whenever possible. For the purpose of this repo, the instructions in the recipes count as "Software". You're a computer executing the instructions in the recipes. I don't know how this works in legalese, but this is my intent, if you try to interpret what my intent was.
