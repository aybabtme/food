## step 1: 0h00

1. 100g of lukewarm water
2. 2 tbls of sourdough live culture
3. 100g of bread flour

Mix waterm sourdough and then flour. Let sit in a warm environment, until it doubles in size. (~4h).

## step 2: 4h00

1. 200g of the sourdough mix from step 1
2. 400g of water
3. 600g of bread flour

Combine water first, then sourdough then flour. 
Mix until the crumbles are gone. 

Let it rest for 30 min covered (plastic wrap) in the mixing bowl.

## step 3: 4h30

1. 12g of salt
2. Splash of water to dissolve the salt.

Mix until the salt dissolves.

Knead the dough on a non-pourous surface using a routine. (TODO include description of routine).
(or use the kneading hook on your robot mixer)

Let it rest covered (plastic wrap) in the mixing bowl in a warn spot.

## step 4: 8h30

1. Drop the dough onto an unfloured countertop.
2. Sprinkle the dough with flour.
3. Flip the dough.

Doing quick and confident moves, we start building tension: 

1. Fold the edges in and over the center.

Let it rest covered (plastic wrap) on the non-pourous surface for 30 min.

## step 5: 9h00

The dough will have flattened.

1. Sprinkle the dough with flour.
2. Flip the dough.

Doing quick and confident moves, with the picture of an envelope in mind:

1. Fold the bottom to 2/3 of top.
2. Fold the right to 2/3 left.
3. Fold the left to 2/3 right.
4. Fold the top to completely to bottom.
5. Fold the bottom to top.
6. Roll it up.

The seam of the joint in the dough should be facing down.

Use your hands or a flat knife, and slowly but firmly push the dough in all directions. You should be able to feel the surface tension building up.

1. Cover a bowl with a kitchen towel.
2. Dust it liberally with flour (bread flour, or 50/50 mix of rice/bread flour works better)
3. Dust the dough ball as well.
4. Transfer the dough ball upside down in the basket.

The seam should now be facing up.

1. Dust with flour.
2. Cover by folding the corners of the towel over one anouther.

Let it cool in the fridge overnight (~10h or more).

## step 6: 19h00

Take the dough out 2h before baking it. It should be gently bouncing back to the touch.

## step 7: 21h00

Heat up a Dutch Oven in the oven at 250ºC (485ºF) for 30 to 60min.

## step 8: 22h00

1. Gently flip the dough upside down on a floured surface.
2. Take the Ducth Oven out and place the dough inside as gently as possible.
3. Score it with a razor blade, all the way though but not too deep, at a very low degree angle (almost vertically).
4. Before putting the lid back on, spray the inside with water.
5. Put the setup in the oven quickly.
6. Lower the temperature to 220ºC (430ºF).
7. Keep the lid on for 25min.
8. Bake it for another 25min or so.

## step 8: 22h50

Take the bread out, let it cool down on a rack for 1h.

## step 9: 23h50

Eat it!
