# Kombucha

Get a SCOBY from someone in your area who's making kombucha, or buy one online.

Prior reading: please read [this report](http://food-safety.guru/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/JEH11-13_Special_Report_Kombucha-Brewing.pdf) if you want to know how to do all this safely.

## step 1: 0h00

1. 2500g of water
2. 150g of sugar
3. 8 bags of black tea (Earl Grey, Oolong, wtv). Other teas may work.

Bring the water to a boil. Let it boil for a minute, then stop the heat.  Add the sugar and tea. Let it steep for 10min.

## step 2: 0h30

Let the mix cool down to room temperature.

## step 3: 1h30

1. 250g of existing non-pasteurized Kombucha.
2. 1 SCOBY 

Add the mix of tea and sugar into a dark opaque jar. Add the existing kombucha, add the SCOBY. Cover the jar with a coffee filter (or fabric). Put the jar in a dark spot that has a fairly stable, preferably elevated temperature (>20ºC). Let it brew for at least 7 days, but preferably no more than 10. The longer, the less sugar and the more acidic. If it is too acidic, the brew might be dangerous due to the acidity. If it is not acidic enough, the brew might allow dangerous bacterias to grow along.

## step 4: 7th (or 10th) day

Transfer the brew from the jar into bottles that can be pressurized. At this point, you can start a new batch right away by leaving at least 250mL of the brew in the jar, and return to *step 1* to refill the jar.

Let the brew ferment again in the bottles for 2 to 3 days. The fermentation will produce CO2, which will make the brew fizzy. 

## step 5: 9th day

Put the bottles in the fridge to slow down the fermentation. Consume them.

## notes

The fabric.

>  something that will let air go through but won't let any insect. Towel, coffee filter, paper towel... or tightly wound single layer of light fabric.

The jar.
> The jar can be anything, but it should be dark and have a large-ish opening. The SCOBY will grow to be as large as the opening, even if you start from a small one to begin with. The jar needs to be dark to protect the fermentation process from UV lights.

The SCOBY (and kombucha).
> The sweet tea should grow a mix of yeast and bacteria (a SCOBY) if you let it sit for a bit in a warm, dark spot and the conditions are right. However, you could also grow other things than that (e.g: mold) if you're not lucky. It's thus much simpler to grow the right thing (a SCOBY) if you start with an existing one, or if you use a bit of unpasteurized kombucha that contains the right yeast and bacterias to begin with. However, they're not necessarily required. Your brew will come together much faster if you use them.
